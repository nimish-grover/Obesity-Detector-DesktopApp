## Project Overview

The Obesity Detector Desktop Application is a Python-based Jupiter Notebook project designed to help users estimate their body mass index (BMI) and assess their risk of obesity. This interactive application utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user-provided data, including height and weight, to determine BMI and predict the obesity using your vitals and images.

## Sample Output

   <img src="/image/main.png"/>
   <img src="/image/image.png" width="320" height="300"/>
</p>
<p align = "center">
   <img src="/image/text.png"/>
</p>

## Features

- Calculate BMI based on user input.
- Assess obesity risk based on BMI values.
- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Predict Obesity with vitals and image.
- Easily customizable and extensible for future enhancements.
